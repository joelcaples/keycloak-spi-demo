Notes:

	- Out of the box support for 2FA using TOTP. Advertises support for Google 
	  Authenticator or FreeOTP, but seems to work with any authenticator.  Also
      tested with LastPass Authenticator
      - To configure Hash, # Digits, Expiration configuratble in Keycloak: 
	    - In Keycloak: Configure -> Authentication -> OTP Policy
      - To require all new Users to use Authenticator 2FA:
	    - In Keycloak: Configure -> Authentication -> Required Actions -> Check 
		  Configure OTP "Default Action" checkbox
	  - To require all existing Users to configure and use Authenticator 2FA:
		- TBD

Suggested Cards:

	1. As a User, I want to see my name in the toolbar of the application 
	   so that I know the context of the currently logged in user
	
	2. As a User, I want a Logout link in the toolbar of the application 
	   so that I can terminate the currently logged in Session
	
	3. As a System Administrator, I want to be able to configure my application
	   to use MFA via Google Authenticator or FreeOtp
	   So that I can provide 2-Factor Authentication Capabilities
